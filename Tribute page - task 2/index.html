            by Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai and at Bishop Cotton

            School in New York City. In 1959, he then received a degree in
            Architecture from Cornell University, and in 1975, attended the
            seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard Business School â€”
            an institution which he has since endowed. Ratan Tata's leadership
            and business acumen have been widely recognized, both in India and
            around the world. He has been instrumental in the success of many
            Tata Group companies, including
